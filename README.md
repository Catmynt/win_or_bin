Tinder-style Swiping for D&amp;D Race Selection aimed at New Players

In my experience, many new players are somewhat overwhelmed by the wide variety of playable races when making their first characters. This tool aims to resolve that issue by giving a general impression of what each race looks like, as well as some of their defining characteristics.

Goals:
- Allow new D&D players to pick a race for their D&D character based on aesthetics and the unique features of each race.
- Make it fun and easy to compare and contrast the many races that are available.

V0.1
Many features still to be added, including
- Win/Bin Button Functionality
- A back button to return to the previous race for reconsideration
- Support for multiple images of a single race, and an animation to switch between them.
- Mobile Support
