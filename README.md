Tinder-style Swiping for D&amp;D Race Selection aimed at New Players

In my experience, many new players are somewhat overwhelmed by the wide variety of playable races when making their first characters. This tool aims to resolve that issue by giving a general impression of what each race looks like, as well as some of their defining characteristics.

Goals:
- Allow new D&D players to pick a race for their D&D character based on aesthetics and the unique features of each race.
- Make it fun and easy to compare and contrast the many races that are available.

How to Use:
- Swipe Right by Clicking and Dragging (or swipe if on mobile) the image to the right of the screen, where it will be added to your Win list
– Similarly, swipe Left to add the current D&D race to your Bin list
– If lit up and active, click / tap the yellow arrow button to view other pictures of the current D&D race
– The 'Win' and 'Bin' buttons may also be clicked to add the current D&D race to the respective list (desktop only)

V0.2
Many features still to be added, including
- A back button to return to the previous race for reconsideration
– Improved results screen(s)
– Coloured overlays to better visually indicate which swipe direction is win/bin (especially helpful on mobile)
